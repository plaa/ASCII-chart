No-nonsense ASCII chart
=======================

This repo contains a no-nonsense ASCII chart.  It is designed (unlike most ASCII charts on the net) to be efficient and easily legible even at a distance.

The chart features:

* the hex code and character, easily legible from two meters away
* the decimal code, since this is occasionally needed
* only the control characters I have ever heard about  (except NUL - everyone knows that anyway)
* numbers and letters as a range, not individually printed out
* no nonsense

I recommend highlighting the most often used characters with a yellow highlighting pen (for web developers e.g. %, &, ? and =).
